<span class="dropcap">F</span>rancisco Jose Mallmann, hijo del físico nuclear Carlos Mallmann, nació en Buenos Aires y creció en la Villa Llao Llao, en las cercanías de Bariloche, donde su padre se desempeñó como director del Instituto Balseiro. A los 16 años y al no estar interesado en ir la escuela, decidió irse de su casa y viajar a California motivado por los movimientos juveniles hippies de la época, donde vivió 2 años mientras trabajó como carpintero y jardinero.

At the age of 18 and back in Argentina, he opened a small restaurant in his hometown in Patagonia with an English friend, where he would give his first steps cooking professionally. By the time he was 22, he realized that he liked cooking so much that he moved to France to grow his career around the best chefs in the culinary world.

He wrote to all 21 ‘three-star’ French restaurants of the time, asking for an apprenticeship, and finally spent 4 years in France working for eight of the best restaurants in Paris and Lyon. He has mentioned that France was very generous with him and very rigorous as well. After these years Mallmann returned to Argentina to work as the Chef for an ‘haute cuisine’ restaurant in Buenos Aires.

At the age of 40, he was awarded the ‘Grand Prix de l’Art de la Cuisine’, being the first non-European to receive the prize. Later he has expressed that at the moment he was happy and sad at the same time because he considered he hadn’t found his own language of cooking yet. Therefore he went back to basics, remembering his upbringing in Patagonia and focused on using fire, the way native people from Argentina cooked in the Andes, the Pampas and in the fields of South America.

### Mallmann and Wine

In an interview with Chef Dorothy Cann Hamilton, Mallmann stated that he does not like wine pairings, “I don’t believe in harmony in food, I like dissonance. I believe that when you eat and drink you want to have some excellent food with an excellent wine that has nothing to do with the food, so it clashes in your mouth.”

He also defies the typical archetype of ‘steak with red’ and ‘fish with white’ by mentioning “Having a nice steak with a good red wine is perfect, but is boring because is so harmonious. I’d rather have an elegant white fish with a strong red wine.”

About his preferences of wine he has expressed a liking towards old elegant thin wines. In an interview with the publication Vogue during a trip to Napa Valley, he revealed a love for California Cabs and Pinot Noir, citing some names as Bond, Harlan, Screaming Eagle, Staglin and Stag’s Leap, as some of his favorites.

Today Francis Mallmann owns four restaurants in Argentina, Uruguay and United States and will soon publish his third book ‘Fires of Patagonia’.
