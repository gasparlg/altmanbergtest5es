<span class="dropcap">L</span>a historia de la Vitivinicultura Argentina se remonta a más de 400 años, cuando los primeros especímenes de ‘vitis vinifera’ fueron traídos a Peru, Chile y Argentina por los colonizadores españoles. Una vez en el territorio argentino, las primeras cepas se cultivaron en Santiago del Estero donde se realizaron los primeros vinos nacionales. Sin embargo, las óptimas condiciones climáticas y de suelo de la región andina, hizo que la vitivinicultura tenga un amplio y acelerado desarrollo en el centro-oeste del país, la región de Cuyo.

Decades later, in the XVII century, the provinces of Cuyo, especially Mendoza and San Juan, had already an important wine production, and became suppliers to new markets such as the regions of Buenos Aires, Paraguay and northern Argentina.

### Growth in the newborn Argentine Republic

The wine was artisanal produced for nearly three centuries, until 1827, eleven years after independence, when the first industrial winery of Argentina, the Panquegua winery, was built and registered in the province of Mendoza. During this time, in Europe, General San Martin, (Argentine founding father), used to point out that French wine could not match the wines of Mendoza.

In 1852, French agronomist Michel Aimé Pouget was the first to introduce French grape varieties into the country, boosting its development and teaching new agricultural scientific methods. This was an important period of transformation and modernization for the wine industry in Argentina.

Soon after, Pouget founded the first agricultural School of Argentina in Mendoza. It provided training and development allowing the transformation of Cuyo into becoming the country’s most important wine region. In addition, the arrival of waves of European immigrants gave a boost to the industry, bringing new grapevine varieties, new cultivation techniques and innovation in oenological practices.

This industry momentum was further strengthened and boosted by the inauguration, in 1884, of the railroad connecting Mendoza and San Juan with the nation’s capital city Buenos Aires. The Cuyo region then took on the role of producers of wine to supply the domestic market and, very marginally, the international one, through the port of Buenos Aires.

In the early twentieth century, the industry grew rapidly. During the celebration of the centenary of the Argentine May Revolution in 1910, the winery ‘Colina de Oro’ (Ex-Bodega Giol) proclaimed to be the world’s largest winery at the time.

After the First World War, in 1919, Argentine wines acquired international notoriety for its increasing quality and the excellent results of the European vine stocks in those lands and climates. However, since its beginnings, Argentina never exported as its main objective, but rather the industry grew based on the consumption of the domestic market. During this period, Argentine producers leaned to export only to sell their occasional surpluses in production.

An anecdote of the exports in the 1980’s is the first shipment of Argentine wine to Russia. At the time, Argentina and the URSS made commercial agreements where Argentina would export wine in exchange of Soviet trolleybuses, which transited the streets of Mendoza city for several decades until they were withdrawn from circulation in 2009 and sold to another Argentine province.

### Decrease in consumption and changes in the industry

Since the 1970’s and 1980’s, the Argentine wine industry had to endure recurring mismatches between production and consumption. This situation was intensified over time with a steep decrease in wine consumption until 2010.

Between late 1980’s and early 1990’s a new period in Argentina’s wine industry begun. The national economy was integrated into the international markets and new medium and small productions of high quality wine emerged in the industry. Its wines were intended for both the national and international markets. These changes in the industry favored the recognition and positioning of Argentine wines across the global markets.

This increase in exports helped offset the decline of domestic consumption and it was an incentive for the development of the industry as a competitive exporter. Wine exports are an incremental business model, because it generates additional benefits for the rest of the wineries with potential to sell in foreign markets. This is due to the degression in positioning and promotion costs of Argentine wines in those foreign markets with each commercial transaction made.

Along with the expansion of Argentine wines in the world, there was an exponential growth of local, national, and international tourism in the wine regions of Argentina. This boom helped boost regional economies like gastronomy and hospitality which in many cases are pillars of local economies and main sources of jobs for their communities along with the winemaking activities.

### 200 Years Later

At the time of the Spanish colonization, the Argentine economic model was based on the export of raw materials. After the independence however, a different economic model was desired by many, one with an impetus in the production and export of value-added goods instead of just raw materials. Today, 200 years later, Argentina still depends economically on the export of raw materials. Nevertheless, the wine industry is a successful example and role model for the country’s businesses in terms of sustainable development of value-added products with a trade surplus.

The objectives of the industry for the year 2020 are to increase the export revenues to 2000 million USD per year and to increase the international wine market share to 10%. This objectives could be achieved by integrating small and medium players in the industry, positioning high quality Argentine wines in the global markets, and increasing the consumption in the national market against other competitive drinks.
